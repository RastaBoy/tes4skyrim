"""Send synthetic keyboard input to the running Skyrim window.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The bridge's console executor needs an "execution context" -- a live object the
console builds in its own stack frame when the game itself dispatches a typed
command. It cannot be synthesized, so the plugin captures it by watching the
game's own CompileAndRun calls (see game_bridge/plugin/console_capture.cpp).

That creates a bootstrap problem: until the game runs ONE console command by
itself, the bridge can compile commands but never run them -- which silently
looks like "the command did nothing". Previously the only fix was for a human to
open the console and press Enter once.

This tool removes that last manual step, so a session can go from a cold launch
to a fully working bridge with no user input at all. It drives the console the
way a player does -- real WM_* key messages to the game's own window -- so the
engine builds the context exactly as it normally would. Nothing is patched and
no engine state is written.

    python tools/live/game_input.py bootstrap        # open console, run a no-op, close
    python tools/live/game_input.py type "coc riverwood" --enter
    python tools/live/game_input.py key ENTER

The console key is the one bound in Skyrim's controlmap; `~` (grave) is the
default and is what `bootstrap` uses.

# 🛑 PostMessage DOES NOT WORK ON SKYRIM.
#
# Skyrim reads the keyboard through DirectInput, which polls the device state
# directly and never looks at the window's message queue. PostMessage'd
# WM_KEYDOWN/WM_CHAR are accepted by the window and ignored by the game --
# silently, which is the worst kind of failure (verified 2026-08-14: the
# bootstrap "succeeded" and the console never opened).
#
# SendInput injects at the driver level, below DirectInput, so the game sees a
# real key. The cost is that it goes to whatever window has focus -- so we must
# focus the game first, and scan codes matter more than virtual keys because
# DirectInput is scan-code based.

# 🛑 dwExtraInfo must be ULONG_PTR, not POINTER(c_ulong).
#
# With a POINTER field ctypes lays the struct out so that sizeof(INPUT) is
# wrong for the platform, and SendInput rejects every call with error 87
# (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER) while returning 0 -- silently sending nothing,
# which reads exactly like "the game ignored my keypress" (2026-08-14).
