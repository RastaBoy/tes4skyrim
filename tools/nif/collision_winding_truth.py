"""Measure the REAL inverted-collision rate of a mesh tree, against the render mesh.

This is the ground-truth instrument the other winding tools lack.  It does not
run the repair and does not ask what the repair would change; it asks the prior
question:

    how much of this tree's collision is actually wound wrong?

Method: for every near-horizontal collision face, find the render face
COINCIDENT with it (same plane, same XY spot -- tolerances matched to
`_FLOOR_PLANE_DZ` / `_FLOOR_XY` in asset_convert.collision).  The artist's
visual winding is correct by construction, so a collision face pointing
opposite its own render skin is genuinely inverted -- you fall through a
surface you can see.  Faces with no coincident skin are not counted either way,
because nothing decides them.

THE THIN-SLAB TRAP (why "nearest skin" is not good enough).  A stair tread, a
shelf, a table top or a well rim is a thin slab, and BOTH of its skins fall
inside any tolerance loose enough to match at all.  Deciding on raw proximity
therefore picks the wrong skin routinely, in both directions:

  * an UP-facing collision face matched against the tread's UNDERSIDE skin --
    measured on bravilstairs01/02/04 + anvilwell01, ALL 48 "inverted"
    verdicts were decided by a skin below the face (mean dz -0.04, none from
    above).  Every one was a correctly wound stair.
  * a DOWN-facing collision face (a shelf's own correct underside) matched
    against the shelf TOP one thickness above it -- this is what made
    Oblivion furniture read as 16% inverted (upperbookshelf01, upperdesk01,
    mageguilddesk01 are all this).

So a skin may only decide a face it could actually BE: an up-facing face is
decided by a skin at or above it, a down-facing face by a skin at or below it
(_SLAB_EPS slack for float noise).  Anything on the far side of the slab is a
different surface and does not vote.  Without both halves of that rule this
tool manufactures defects out of ordinary furniture and staircases.

Use this BEFORE enabling the winding repair for a plugin.  A tree that measures
near-zero does not need the repair, and turning it on there can only cost
false positives; a tree with a real defect rate is a candidate.  Measured:

    Oblivion architecture/imperialcity : 1 of 5156  (0.02%)

but that figure is for ONE tree and does not generalise: meshes/rocks measures
14.5% of decidable floor faces inverted in vanilla (seisland.nif, the Shivering
Isles island, is 1480 of 3590 triangles).  The "vanilla Oblivion is authored
correctly" claim is WITHDRAWN -- see docs/nif_conversion_notes.md "round 3".

NOTE ON USING THIS AS A SCORER.  This tool shares its coincidence rule and its
constants with asset_convert.collision._component_visual_vote (step 2 of the
repair), so scoring a repair variant that CONTAINS step 2 is partly self-
grading and reads high.  It is a fair referee for the authored-normal step,
which uses an entirely independent signal.
