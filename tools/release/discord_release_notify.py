"""Post a release changelog to a Discord channel via an incoming webhook.

Used by .github/workflows/tag-on-push.yml right after the GitHub Release is
created, but it runs standalone against any notes file:

    python tools/release/discord_release_notify.py --notes notes.txt --tag 0.591 \
                                           --repo bryantmh/tes4skyrim
    python tools/release/discord_release_notify.py --notes notes.txt --tag 0.591 --dry-run

The webhook URL comes from $DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL (a repo secret in CI) and is
never accepted on the command line -- an argv secret is visible to every other
process on the machine via the process table, and CI would echo it into the log
with `set -x`.

ONLY code releases go through here.  The navmesh cache publishes its own
`navmesh-cache-*` releases from tools/navmesh/navmesh_cache.py on a developer machine,
which no workflow drives, so a cache publish never reaches this script.

Written against urllib, not requests: the workflow's runner has a bare Python
with no pip install step, and this needs exactly one POST.
