"""Generate ALL distant LOD, ONCE, into a standalone AutoConvertLOD mod.

LOD used to be a per-plugin pipeline step (`convert.py --lod-only -f X`) that
wrote into `output/<plugin>/`, followed by a separate "Merge Sibling LOD" pass
that rebaked whatever two plugins both claimed. That is three bakes of the same
ground: LOD tiles are FILES on a fixed grid keyed only by worldspace and
coordinate (`meshes/terrain/<wrld>/Objects/<wrld>.4.-32.-32.bto`), so every
plugin editing a worldspace generates the SAME tile paths. Converting four
siblings produced four rival copies of each shared tile, the mod manager's
install order silently picked a winner, and the merge pass then threw all of
them away and baked a fifth.

There is no per-plugin LOD here. For each worldspace the bake reads records
from the plugin that OWNS it and applies every other selected plugin as an
overlay in load order — which is what the generators have always supported, and
what makes one tile correct for the whole load order. Each tile is written
exactly once, into one mod folder the user installs like any other.

Because the output is a single standalone mod, nothing overwrites anything:
there are no rival copies to resolve, so there is no contested-tile maths, no
`only_cells` restriction and no merge stage. Install it after the plugins it
covers.

Order is lowest priority FIRST — the last plugin listed wins any reference two
of them both change. The default is the user's plugins.txt order, with anything
it does not list appended at the bottom alphabetically but never before its own
masters (see sibling_lod.create_lod_order).
