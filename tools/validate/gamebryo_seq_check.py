"""Audit generated behavior graphs for BGSGamebryoSequenceGenerator problems.

Why this exists: the generator resolves `pSequence` BY NAME against the NIF's
NiControllerManager sequence map at runtime.  A name that resolves to nothing
gives a NULL sequence, which the engine dereferences the moment that state is
entered -- `movdqu xmm2,[rax]` with rax=0 inside VCRUNTIME140, under
BGSGamebryoSequenceGenerator (crash-2026-08-10-01-08-13).

Because the state machine STARTS in the Rest state, an unresolvable name there
crashes on the object's very first animation.

Three checks, calibrated against vanilla (51 Behavior00.hkx that use a
Gamebryo generator, extracted from Skyrim - Animations.bsa: 0 violations):

  1. every NON-Rest generator names a sequence the sibling NIF declares,
     and never an empty name (that null sequence is deref'd on activation)
  2. the Rest generator's pSequence is EMPTY.  Empty is CORRECT there --
     nothing should play on cell load, and the working doors ship exactly
     this (see "The Rest state is CORRECT" in docs/nif_conversion_notes.md).
     A Rest naming a real sequence animates the object on load (the
     self-opening secret doors)
  3. no sequence in a graph-carrying NIF has an EMPTY text key value.  On
     activation the generator walks NiTextKeyExtraData and `strchr`s each
     value for '.' (GOG exe 0x505130, AddrLib ID 32774); an empty NiString
     loads as a NULL BSFixedString and the strchr crashes — the Spiddal
     Stick / Harrada Root CTDs (crash-2026-08-10-01-41-07 / -01-39-02).
     Vanilla ships empty keys ONLY on graph-less meshes (impjaildoor01,
     ruinscanopicjar02), never beside a behavior graph.

Usage:
    python tools/validate/gamebryo_seq_check.py <output-meshes-dir> [--quiet]

Exit code is 1 if any graph names a sequence its mesh does not provide.
