"""Measure what CONDITION EVALUATION actually costs in the running game.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
NPC activation and a scripted Say() share exactly one expensive engine step:
the engine walks the candidate INFOs of a topic and evaluates each one's CTDA
stack until one qualifies.  Everything else about the two paths differs, so a
stutter common to BOTH points here.  Papyrus-side timing cannot see it (the
walk is native), and stack sampling cannot be used -- taking thousands of
`~* k` stack walks suspends every thread and FREEZES the game (measured
2026-08-16; the attach is non-invasive, the sampling is not).

So measure it where it happens: hook the condition evaluator and count.

THE TARGET
----------
`TESCondition::Run` -- Address Library id **21971** (offset 0), the function
that evaluates one condition stack.  Identified statically, not guessed:

  * The CTDA function-info table is at rva 0x1e45a10 (1.6.659), stride 0x50,
    indexed by CTDA function id.  Verified by decoding it: id 426 ->
    "GetIsVoiceType", id 630 -> "GetVMScriptVariable", matching the function
    numbers this project's converter emits.
  * Exactly five sites reference that table.  0x303cd1 is the accessor
    (`id*0x50 + base; ret`, id 21963).  0x305460 is the consumer that indexes
    the table and dispatches on the entry -- the evaluator (id 21971).

Identifying by the table it indexes is the proof of identity that
project_find_engine_functions_via_rtti requires; nothing here rests on a
plausible-looking prologue.

USE
---
Bridge must be up (game under skse64_loader.exe with TESGameBridge.dll).

    # 1. verify the target resolves and is safe to hook (DRY RUN, no hook)
    python tools/dialog/ctda_cost_probe.py --analyze

    # 2. arm it, then play until the stutter happens
    python tools/dialog/ctda_cost_probe.py --arm

    # 3. read the counter -- how many condition evaluations since arming
    python tools/dialog/ctda_cost_probe.py --read

    # bracket ONE action (activate an NPC, trigger a Say) and count it:
    python tools/dialog/ctda_cost_probe.py --bracket 8
    #   -> "press activate now", counts evaluations over 8 seconds

    # 4. always remove the hook when done
    python tools/dialog/ctda_cost_probe.py --remove

WHAT THE NUMBER MEANS
---------------------
The converted plugin carries 110,634 CTDAs total, INFOGENERAL alone holding
33,872 across 1,854 INFOs (measured from the built ESM by
the removed dialog_selection_cost.py).  Vanilla Skyrim's mean is 3.7 per topic.

  * ~thousands of evaluations per activation  -> the walk IS the stutter, and
    the fix is to cut the per-topic condition volume.
  * ~tens                                     -> the engine rejects topics
    cheaply before the walk; condition volume is NOT the cause and this whole
    line of investigation is dead.  Say so and look elsewhere.

That is a decidable question, which is the point.

🛑 A hook on a HOT function can crash the game (a compile-finalizer hook did,
2026-08-14).  --analyze first, ALWAYS, and --remove when finished.
