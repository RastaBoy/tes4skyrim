        The fix is a stage-arrival latch: remember the stage this quest was on
        when we last saw it, and require at least one poll pass at stage N
        before honouring the guard.  That pass is what lets stage N's fragment
        run and charge the timer.  25 guards of this shape exist in the
        Oblivion build; the CharacterGen ones are simply the ones that show.

        `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS` is NOT sound for this question — 14 of its
        entries are declared on `ObjectReference` too (`GetDistance`, `AddItem`,
        `GetItemCount`, `Say`, `PlaceAtMe`, `SetScale`, ...), which is exactly
        why `_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS` exists and why the call-site cast at
        `_emit_function` already subtracts it.  Here the set must be subtracted
        as well: an upgrade is not a cosmetic type widening but a hard runtime
        failure.  Papyrus binds a script to a form only when the declared base
        type matches, so an `extends Actor` script on a WEAP/ACTI/CONT/DOOR is
        rejected outright — *"Unable to bind script X because their base types
        do not match"* — and never runs at all.  A bare `GetDistance` upgraded
        88 non-actor scripts that way, 67 of which the last in-game run logged
        as unbindable (`GoblinHeadScript` on `GoblinShamanStaff`, every
        `Dark*DeadDropScript`, the Daedric statue scripts, the Publican inn
        triggers).  `get_extends_class` already answers this correctly from the
        attaching record's signature, so only a genuinely Actor-only call may
        override it.

        The scan must also see CODE ONLY.  Run over the raw source it matched
        prose — `MessageBox "…not kill them!"` (`DAMalacathStatueScript`),
        `; evp the post guards` (`ICUmbacanoExitDoorScript`),
        `;StartCombat to get the scene rolling` (`SE09AltarScript`) — and each
        of those upgraded a DOOR/ACTI script into an unbindable one.  Comments
        and string literals are therefore stripped per line first.

        Finally, a function whose TES4 form names its target as an ARGUMENT
        (`GetDeadCount JesanRilian`, `SetEssential SEMuurine 0`) says nothing
        about the calling script's own type — both are `ActorBase` methods in

            # TES4_PCSleeping flag standing in for isPCSleeping.  Menu-id
            # blocks and non-sleep bare blocks stay commented (below).
            # SECOND EXCEPTION — a bare `begin MenuMode` that does NOT read
            # isPCSleeping.  The blowout above was caused entirely by the
            # menu-ID form: all five MQ01 blocks carry an id (1, 1002, 1014,
            # 1023, 1030), and censused over the corpus not one bare block is
            # a menu-specific trigger.  What the 20 bare bodies actually are is
            # time-and-inventory bookkeeping that Oblivion runs on the frames
            # where GameMode does NOT run — the wait/sleep and inventory
            # frames.  Several say so in their own comments (ErthorScript:
            # "contingency if player is waiting/resting"; SE02OrcCaptainScript
            # guards on `isTimePassing`), and the innkeeper rent timers
            # (7 near-identical Publican* scripts) can only ever advance while
            # a menu is open.  Dropping them silently deletes that logic:

            # `set GotFinger to 1`.

            #    `setstage 43` was lost -- the birthsign menu never opened;
            #  * the QUEST poll's `stage 45 && convTimer <= 0 -> setstage 50`
            #    fired while the player was still in the stage-44 dialogue
            #    (Skyrim runs the reply's End result with the menu open), and
            #    stage 50's evp sent Baurus in to force-greet over it -- the
            #    "Baurus interrupts the Emperor" the user saw on most runs;
            #  * Baurus's stage-19 torch line (`getdistance player < 250 &&
            #    sayPlayer == 0 -> sayTo player CharGenVoice`) fired into the
            #    Emperor dialogue the same way.
            # In Oblivion none of these polls ran until the menu had closed.

        **A TES4->TES5 semantic difference, not a style fix.**  In Oblivion,
        `set Q.Var to 1` writes a quest variable that persists whether or not
        the quest is running, and a later `StartQuest Q` does not disturb it --
        so the authored idiom "seed the variables, then start the quest" is
        safe and extremely common.  In Skyrim, `Quest.Start()` on a STOPPED
        quest initialises its scripts, resetting every `Auto` property to its
        default.  Converted literally, every seeded value is silently wiped by
        the `Start()` that follows it.

        That is what softlocked the Imperial City Arena: the match INFO sets
        `Arena.ReadyMatch = 1` and then calls `Arena.Start()` four lines later
        (`Arena` is `Stop()`ped after every match by its own stage 10), so
        ReadyMatch was always back to 0 by the time the announcer polled it.
        The announcer's first gate is `ReadyMatch == 1`, so it never spoke,
        `GateDownFight` was never set, the gates never opened.  Measured
        2026-08-18: **131 clobbered writes across 65 scripts** -- the arena
        matches, the arena betting (ArenaSpectator), FGC01, MS16B and more.

        The reordering is only applied within one straight-line run: a branch,
        loop or return between the write and the `Start()` means the two may
        not both execute, so the sequence is left exactly as authored.

    # object/actor script.
    #
    # The gate is CELL-SCOPED (attached parent cell), matching TES4, with
    # Is3DLoaded() only as a fast path.  It must satisfy TWO independent
    # requirements, and an implementation meeting just one is silently broken:
    #
    # 1. Never throw on a held item (see the container note below).
    # 2. Stay true for a reference with no 3D.  A disabled ref, or one whose
    #    own poll body calls Disable(), keeps ticking in TES4.  Gating on 3D
    #    alone deadlocks both the self-ENABLE idiom (~200 Nehrim refs incl.
    #    Celebro) and the self-DISABLE one — Nehrim MQ00LichtScript disables
    #    itself, then five seconds later fires the plugin's only
    #    `SetStage MQ00 2`, whose result script holds the only
    #    EnablePlayerControls.  A 3D gate pins that quest at stage 1 with the
    #    player's controls locked forever.
    #
    # This was once reverted to a 3D-only gate to chase a CharacterGen
    # regression (Valen Dreth not reaching his taunt marker).  That was a
    # misattribution: Dreth is fixed by the UNGATED OnLoad emitted above, which
    # this gate does not affect.
    # 🛑 NOT a bare Is3DLoaded().  An item sitting INSIDE A CONTAINER has no
    # 3D and no parent cell, and calling Is3DLoaded() on it raises
    #   "Unable to call Is3DLoaded - no native object bound to the script
    #    object, or object is of incorrect type"
    # which ABORTS THE WHOLE OnUpdate EVENT AT THAT LINE -- including the
    # RegisterForSingleUpdate that keeps the poll alive.  The script is then

        TES4 dispositions run -100..+100.  Skyrim only stores a four-value
        Group Combat Reaction, so the amount is bucketed onto the tier that
        preserves the intent:

            <= -50   Enemy    (`setfactionreaction X Y -100` = "now hate them")
            <  0     Neutral  (a mild grudge is not open warfare)
            == 0     Neutral  (explicitly clearing a relation)
            >  0     Friend   (goodwill between two DIFFERENT factions)

        Positive amounts stop at Friend and never reach Ally.  A TES4
        disposition is a 0-100 scalar meaning "likes them more"; TES5's Ally is
        a hard contract that makes members ASSIST each other into combat (UESP
        Skyrim:Factions — reaction combines with aggression and assistance to
        decide who joins a fight).  Since `setfactionreaction` always names two
        DIFFERENT factions, promoting its positive amounts to Ally wired
        bystanders into other people's fights.  Ally is reserved for a
        faction's relation to itself, which only the FACT record path emits
        (see convert_FACT in tes5_import/record_types/actors.py).

        Returns None when the amount is not a literal, so the caller can emit a
        runtime branch instead.  ModFactionReaction shifts an existing value we
        cannot read at conversion time, so only its SIGN is honoured — that is
        the part vanilla scripts actually depend on.

        A flip naming the TES4 PlayerFaction is mirrored onto the vanilla
        PlayerFaction: the runtime player was never a member of the
        converted record, so the original write reaches nobody.  The mirror
        covers all three tiers — the neutral clear included, because TES4
        uses `setfactionreaction X PlayerFaction 0` mid-scene to stand a
        group down from hunting the player (CharacterGen stage 23), and a
        clear that reaches nobody leaves the real player hunted.

        Nothing else is pushed here.  SetEnemy/SetAlly write the same Group
        Combat Reaction enum vanilla's own scripted battles run on; with the
        package interrupt flags authorising combat behaviour (see
        pack_converter.DEFAULT_INTERRUPT) the engine initiates the fight
        itself, exactly as it does for its own factions.
