"""Oblivion (TES4) -> Skyrim (TES5) dialogue / quest conversion.

Rewritten per the `oblivion-to-skyrim-dialog` skill. The guiding standard is
BEHAVIORAL FIDELITY: a converted plugin should make NPCs say the same lines, to
the same people, at the same times, advancing the same quests — not merely
contain records of the right signatures.

Architecture (the key change from the old universal-quest design):

  * Quest ownership follows the two engines' actual gating models:
      - Oblivion evaluates each INFO only while that INFO's own QSTI quest is
        running (a topic's INFO list is a union across quests).
      - Skyrim's DIAL is owned by exactly ONE quest (QNAM) and its INFOs are
        only evaluated while that quest runs; vanilla models shared subjects
        as one DIAL per quest (Skyrim.esm has ~288 separate HELO topics).
    So: a SINGLE-quest topic is owned by its original quest (remapped) —
    native gating, and the runtime voice path (built from the owning Quest
    EditorID + Topic EditorID + InfoFormID) keeps matching the extracted
    audio. A SHARED (multi-quest) or quest-less topic cannot be faithfully
    owned by any one quest, so it is owned by the always-running synthetic
    quest `TES4DialogueGeneric`, and each of its INFOs gets a
    GetQuestRunning(own QSTI quest) gate reproducing Oblivion's per-INFO
    visibility. (Start-Game-Enabled quests are exempt from the injected gate —
    they run from a new game via the SEQ file, so the gate is redundant.)

  * Skyrim needs structure Oblivion has no source for, which we synthesize:
      - VTYP per speaking NPC (kept as custom TES4* voice types so the converted
        audio folders match) and GetIsVoiceType conditions per INFO.
      - DLBR branches (top-level vs. linked) from topic type + the TCLT graph.
      - One DLVW per owning quest (CK metadata only).

  * AddTopic visibility (no Skyrim equivalent) is re-expressed as conditions:
    GetStage gates derived from `AddTopic`/`SetStage` script analysis, plus
    GetIsID identity gates so conversation topics don't leak to every NPC.

  * Result scripts -> Papyrus VMAD fragments (via script_convert). This is the
    one transform with no data-only path; the fragment is built from the TES4
    SCTX source.

CTDA condition translation lives in dialog_conditions.py.

def compute_quest_priorities(by_type: dict) -> dict:
    """FormID -> effective dialogue-arbitration priority for every QUST.

    Oblivion picks the first passing INFO in QUEST PRIORITY order (highest
    first), NOT file order — Azzan's low-priority(11) first-meeting intro
    would otherwise outrank the priority-60 Fighters Guild ad greeting that
    reveals the join topics. Skyrim arbitrates dialogue by the QUEST's own
    priority (QUST.DNAM.Priority), so the raw TES4 DATA.Priority value is
    carried over for ordinary (staged) quests — EXCEPT that every STAGED
    quest is boosted by a fixed offset so it universally outranks every
    zero-stage "conversation container" quest (MG00General, MQConversations,
    FGConversations, DarkConvSystem, ...), which exist purely to hold
    ambient/HELLO-channel chatter. In Oblivion GREETING and HELLO are
    separate channels, so a container quest's authored priority (sometimes
    deliberately HIGH, e.g. MG00General=61, to win its own HELLO-channel
    arbitration) never competed with a real quest's GREETING. Skyrim merges
    both into one HELO topic per quest, so MG00General outranked
    MG04Restore's priority-60 briefing outright: "Arielle only gives a
    generic greeting" with the journal at the correct stage and every record
    field individually correct. A quest with real stages represents actual
    narrative progress the player is mid-story with, so it must always beat
    a stage-less container quest's greeting.

    The correction is a DOWNWARD CLAMP on container quests alone — staged
    quests keep the priority their author wrote. TES4 priorities already live
    in 0-100 (Oblivion's CS used the same band), so leaving them untouched is
    both faithful and automatically in range; the ONLY thing that has to
    change is a container quest that would outrank a staged one, and pulling
    it down to ZERO_STAGE_TOP achieves the separation without moving anything
    else. Container quests already at or below the ceiling keep their authored
    value, so arbitration AMONG containers (two factions' idle chatter on one
    generic NPC) is preserved exactly.

    Two earlier approaches were WRONG and are recorded so they aren't retried:

      * A uniform UPWARD shift on staged quests OVERFLOWED the band — TES4
        priority 60 + offset 101 = 161 on FGC01Rats, and 265 of 391 quests
        (68%) landed above 100. DNAM.Priority is not just a dialogue tiebreak,
        it also arbitrates a quest ALIAS PACKAGE against an actor's standing
        schedule, so an out-of-band value breaks AI too.
      * RESCALING both groups onto sub-ranges stayed in band but destroyed the
        authored values, collapsing 390 quests onto 35 distinct priorities
        (125 tied at 83). Vanilla does the opposite: 1811 Skyrim.esm quests
        use sparse, meaningful, clustered values (822 at 30, 280 at 0) that a
        continuous remap cannot reproduce.

    Only convert_QUST (the WRITTEN QUST.DNAM.Priority byte) reads this table.
    DIAL PNAM must NOT: vanilla leaves PNAM at the 50.0 default on 5375 of
    6535 player topics AND 659 of 664 Misc/greeting topics, i.e. greetings are
    never boosted above the topic list. Writing quest priority into a bark
    topic's PNAM put FGC01Rats' GREETING at 161 while its player topics stayed
    at 50, and Pinarus lost every topic he owned (mountain-lion AND training).

# Category enum: 0 Topic, 3 Combat, 5 Detection, 6 Service, 7 Misc.
# Reserved Oblivion EditorID -> (Subtype, SNAM, Category).
#
# **SNAM is the field that matters.** TESTopic::LoadForm (SkyrimSE.exe RVA
# 0x3a6fa8) looks SNAM's 4-character tag up in the engine's subtype table and
# writes BOTH the runtime subtype (the matching row's index) and the category
# from it, overwriting whatever DATA held -- and SNAM is stored after DATA in
# all 15,037 vanilla DIALs, so it always wins. See
# docs/dialogue_engine_contracts.md.
#
# The subtype NUMBERS below therefore only have to be well-formed, not exact;
# they are the values vanilla Skyrim.esm happens to store (Hello=73, GoodBye=72,
# Idle=88, Attack=20, ...). The engine's own table numbers those same tags six
# higher (HELO=79, GBYE=78, IDLE=94, ATCK=26), and vanilla itself carries both
# variants -- 288 HELO records say 73 and 9 say 79 -- which is only possible
# because nothing reads the field. Do not "fix" a converted topic by adjusting
# these numbers; check its SNAM instead.
#
# (Note the on-disk order is flags U8 + SUBTYPE U8 + CATEGORY U16, not the
# reverse: vanilla HELO reads DATA=00 49 07 00 = subtype 0x49, category 7.)

    the same prefix for the "%s_%08X_%u" case). Do NOT re-derive this from
    observed filenames — Oblivion's own names follow a DIFFERENT rule, and
    fitting them produces a prefix the engine never asks for.

    The engine loads the TOPIC's owning quest ([rcx+0x40]) EditorID into
    buffer A and the topic's own EditorID into buffer B, then:

        lenA = strlen(A); lenB = strlen(B)

    So a combined length of 25 or less is used verbatim; past that the
    quest is only cut when it exceeds 10, and the topic absorbs the rest.

    condition in a Say-driven topic evaluates against nothing and can never
    pass — CharacterGen's Valen Dreth taunts (race-of-target picks the line)
    froze the whole intro this way, and 1,900+ INFOs across every scripted
    conversation share the defect.  The script call sites tell us who the
    target actually is: when it's unique (usually the player), the condition
    is retargeted to RunOn=Reference on that ref — equivalent semantics, and
    equally valid if the topic is also reachable as menu dialogue (there the
    target IS the player).  Topics with mixed/unresolvable targets drop their
    target conditions instead: the Oblivion call sites already select
    speaker+topic, so auto-pass is closer to intent than never-pass.

    WoodElf/DarkElf->HighElf, Orc->Nord, Breton females->Imperial. The BSA has

    `master_export` adds the MASTERS' actors. A dependent plugin writes dialogue
    for its master's NPCs (15 speakers in ElsweyrPelletine.esp), and a speaker
    with no entry here reaches _topic_voice_types/_build_injected_ctdas as
    nothing, so the line falls back to a default voice type. The masters' RACEs
