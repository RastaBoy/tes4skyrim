"""Stitch adjacent exterior cell navmeshes together with Edge Links.

Why this exists
---------------
A navmesh can be geometrically perfect and still useless.  Skyrim connects one
cell's navmesh to the next through **Edge Links**; without them every cell mesh
is an isolated island, so an actor paths fine inside its current cell and can
NEVER cross a cell boundary.  Every AI package whose destination is in another
cell then starts (the actor stands up, plays its en-route dialogue) and never
moves — which is exactly how converted quest travel/escort packages failed.

Measured against Skyrim.esm: **12,145 of 14,440 vanilla exterior navmeshes (84%)
carry edge links, 194,744 in total** (Portal 190,779 / LedgeUp 1,978 /
LedgeDown 1,987).  We emitted zero.

Binary contract (verified; Skyrim.esm parses 15,949/15,949 clean with it)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Edge Link = ``Type(U32) + Navmesh(FormID U32) + Triangle(S16)`` = **10 bytes**
  (not 12 — a 12-byte stride misparses every navmesh that has links).
* A triangle's flag bits 0/1/2 mean ``Edge 0-1 / 1-2 / 2-0 Link``.  When bit N is
  set, that triangle's edge-N field is an **index into the Edge Links array**
  instead of a local neighbour-triangle index (xEdit ``wbEdgeToStr``).
* Edge Link Type 0 = Portal (the cell-seam link), 1 Ledge Up, 2 Ledge Down,
  3 Enable/Disable Portal.
* Links are **reciprocal**: vanilla NAVM 0x00101F29 grid (7,7) links to its four
  orthogonal neighbours (6,7)x15 (8,7)x11 (7,6)x22 (7,8)x15 and each neighbour
  links back the identical count.

Approach
--------
Runs as a post-pass over the precomputed navmesh cache, after every cell mesh
exists (it needs neighbour NAVM FormIDs and final triangle indices) and before
the group builders serialise them.  Cells are processed in sorted order and each
mesh's links are appended in sorted order, so the output stays byte-reproducible
(see the determinism contract in CLAUDE.md).
