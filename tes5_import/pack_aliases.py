"""Quest-package planning: which TES4 packages belong to which quest, and the
reference aliases those packages need.

Why this exists
---------------
In Oblivion a quest package is just a package sitting at the top of an actor's
AI list with a `GetStage MyQuest >= 50` condition.  The actor re-evaluates, the
condition passes, the package wins.

Skyrim has no such thing.  A package that outranks an actor's standing schedule
must be attached to a QUST *reference alias* via ALPC, and its actor/location
targets resolve through alias indices (PTDA type 4 / PLDT type 9) rather than
raw FormIDs.  Vanilla Skyrim.esm carries 4,125 ALPC entries — this is the
normal way quest AI works, not an exotic path.

So for each TES4 package we must answer:
  1. Is it quest-owned?  (Does any condition reference a quest?)
  2. Which quest?        (-> PACK.QNAM, and which quest gets the ALPC)
  3. Which actor runs it? (-> that actor needs an alias on that quest)
  4. Which refs does it name? (-> those need aliases too, e.g. the player)

Quest ownership is inferred from the package's own conditions.  TES4 condition
functions that name a quest:
    58  GetStage            param1 = QUST
    59  GetStageDone        param1 = QUST
    79  GetQuestVariable    param1 = QUST
    * plus GetQuestRunning (56) / GetQuestCompleted (?) forms
This is exactly the gate Oblivion used, so reading it back gives us the same
"this package belongs to this quest" relation the original content author meant.

    A TES4 GetScriptVariable condition stores the variable's *script-local
    index* (SLSD) in param2 — the name exists only in the SCPT record.  To turn
    such a condition back into a named Papyrus property we need, for the
    reference the condition tests, the variable table of the script attached to
    that reference's BASE record.

    Chain: condition names a REFR -> the REFR's base NPC_/CREA/ACTI -> its SCRI
    -> the SCPT's Variable[i].Index/.Name.

    `master_export` is the MASTERS' export records and is REQUIRED for a plugin
    with masters: any link in that chain may live in the master (a plugin REFR
    of a master base, or a master script), and a break anywhere leaves the
    condition without a variable NAME, so it emits no CIS2 and can never pass.

    Keys stay LOW-24 on purpose.  The only consumer is
    dialog_conditions._convert_script_var_ctda, which looks up a CTDA's param1
    — a RAW TES4 FormID with no load-order offset applied — so it masks to the
    low 24 bits.  Keying this map on the remapped fid instead makes every
    GetScriptVariable/GetQuestVariable condition miss, which silently un-gates
    all of them (Jiub repeats his first line, wrong quests fire).

    Master records are yielded BEFORE the plugin's own so that, with the
    original last-duplicate-wins assignment preserved, a plugin record still
    overrides the master's.  (Using setdefault instead flips precedence to
    first-wins among the plugin's OWN duplicates — many refs share a base and
    many bases share a script — which silently re-gates conditions: DAAzura
    started at game load and its followers packaged onto the player.)

        #   * GetScriptVariable(ref,var) -> the package is gated on an actor's
        #     script variable, which a quest's dialogue/stage script sets.  The
        #     quest is found by asking who WRITES that variable (scriptvar_owner,
        #     built from INFO/QUST result scripts).  FGC01Rats' escort package

        # matches nothing whenever the offset is non-zero (i.e. every real
        # import), so EVERY package silently lost its owning quest: no ALPCs,
        # no quest packages, and each actor fell back to its standing schedule.
