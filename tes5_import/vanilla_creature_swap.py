"""Oblivion creature -> equivalent VANILLA Skyrim creature. REFERENCE DATA.

*** NOTHING IN THE PIPELINE IMPORTS THIS MODULE YET. ***

This is the lookup table for a future converter option that would use a vanilla
Skyrim creature in place of the converted Oblivion one wherever Skyrim already
ships the same creature — trading "looks exactly like the original" for
vanilla-quality animation, ragdoll, sound and combat AI. The table and the
reasoning behind each row are the deliverable; wiring it into convert.py is a
separate, deliberate step that has NOT been taken.

The default path remains `creature_races.py`, which generates a full race chain
per Oblivion creature from its own converted mesh + behavior project.

WHAT A SWAP WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE
---------------------------------
Swapping the RACE alone is not enough and is the trap here: a vanilla race
points its ANAM/NAM3 at a vanilla skeleton + behavior project, so the actor also
needs the vanilla *skin* (WNAM ARMO) or it renders as the Oblivion mesh on a
Skyrim skeleton — bone names will not match and the actor explodes or T-poses.
Each entry therefore carries the race AND its vanilla skin ARMO.

The creature's own STATS should be kept (health, level, damage, factions,
inventory, AI packages, scripts) — only the visual/animation shell swapped, so a
level-40 Oblivion boss stays a level-40 boss wearing a vanilla body.

MATCH QUALITY
-------------
'exact' entries are the same creature in both games. 'near' entries are the same
archetype but a visibly different species (mountain lion vs sabre cat) and
should require an explicit opt-in. Everything absent from this table has no
honest Skyrim equivalent and must be generated — see
docs/creature_race_equivalence.md for the full reasoning, including why the
keyword fallbacks in skyrim_overrides.CREA_RACE_PATTERNS are not equivalences.

Inspect coverage with `python tools/creature/creature_swap_report.py -f <plugin>`.

All FormIDs verified against references/Skyrim.esm/RACE.txt and ARMO.txt.
Several constants in skyrim_overrides.py are WRONG (_SKY_WOLF is ChaurusRace,
_SKY_MAMMOTH is WolfRace, _SKY_CHAURUS is DwarvenSpiderRace); this table does
not use them.
