"""Attach converted TES4 object scripts (SCPT via SCRI) to their records as VMAD.

TES4 object records (ACTI, FLOR, CONT, DOOR, FURN, MISC, KEYM, …) reference a
SCPT record through the ``SCRI`` field.  ``script_convert`` already converts each
such SCPT into a full ``TES4_<EditorID>.psc`` extending ObjectReference/Actor with
its OnActivate / OnLoad / GameMode(→OnUpdate) event handlers, and the pipeline
compiles those to ``.pex``.  What was missing is the binding: without a VMAD
subrecord naming that script on the object record, the engine never attaches it,
so activating an altar showed no message and gave no effect, a nirnroot never
stopped its sound, etc.

This module builds that binding once, up front:

  build_object_script_plan(by_type, xref, fid_to_edid) -> {record_fid_int: VMADinfo}

Each object record's plan carries the script name plus the FormID bindings for its
Object-typed properties (the SCPT's ``ref`` variables and every record the script
names by EditorID), resolved to the OUTPUT plugin's FormID space.  The record
converters then splice the VMAD in right after EDID (Skyrim order: EDID VMAD OBND …).

    """Move an actor's script VMAD from the base NPC_/CREA to its placed ACHR.

    Three independent reasons an actor script MUST live on the reference:

    1. ``GetVMScriptVariable(ref, "::var_var")`` reads the property off a
       script attached to the *reference named in param1* (the ACHR), not off
       the base record — verified against Skyrim.esm, where 100% of vanilla
       func-630 package conditions name a REFR that carries its own VMAD
       holding the variable.  A base-attached script propagates to instances
       for property *access* (fragment writes work), but the condition *read*
       fails, so the quest package never wins its arbitration and the actor
       stays put (Pinarus/FGC01Rats, Arielle/MG04Restore, ~142 actors).

    2. REFERENCE EVENTS never fire on a base-attached script.  ``OnPackageEnd``
       and friends are declared on ``Actor``/``ObjectReference`` (vanilla
       Scripts.zip); ``NPC_`` is an ActorBase, so an event-driven script bound
       there is inert.  This silently killed every converted quest that
       sequences on package completion — CharacterGen sets stage 12 from
       Renote's ``OnPackageEnd``, so the chain stopped at stage 10 and the
       Emperor/guards had no ``GetStage ==`` package to select at all.

    3. SELF-REFERENCE CALLS have no target on a base record.  A bare ``enable``
       / ``moveto`` / ``startcombat`` acts on the calling REFERENCE; an
       ActorBase is not one, so the call does nothing.  Oblivion's standard
       scripted-entrance idiom is an initially-disabled placement whose own
       GameMode block enables it on a cue, which makes this the difference
       between the actor appearing and never existing — Celebro, the Nehrim
       intro companion, was absent from the start cell for exactly this reason
       (``MQ00CelebroScript``: ``if GetStage MQ00 == 5 / enable``).

    Vanilla does exactly this split: instance-identified logic lives on the
    ACHR (masterAmbushScript, 464 placements), while generic per-actor
    behaviour stays on the base (WIDeadBodyCleanupScript, defaultGhostScript).

    The script is moved (base entry removed) rather than duplicated so there is
    exactly ONE instance — both the fragment write (via the ACHR-typed self
    property) and the condition read resolve to it.
