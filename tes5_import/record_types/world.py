    NaN/Inf are equally fatal: every comparison against NaN is false, so both

# Oblivion's renderer synthesises a membrane from the DATA color fields alone,
# so a texture-less EFSH is ordinary there: 42 of Oblivion.esm's 102 records
# name neither a fill (ICON) nor a particle (ICO2) texture.  Skyrim's samples a
# fill texture and modulates it through a gradient palette (NAM8/NAM9) — a
# concept TES4 has no field for — so the same record ported faithfully has
# nothing to sample and composites as opaque black over the actor.  Vanilla
# Skyrim leaves only 4 of its 169 shaders fully texture-less.
#
# Fix: when the source names no texture, borrow the texture set from the
# vanilla shader built for the same job.  The TES4 EditorID is the authored
# indicator — `effectEnchant<School>` and `effect<Element>Shield` say exactly
# which vanilla family the record belongs to — so the match keys off the name,
# never off a color heuristic.  The source's own colors still drive the DATA
# fields; only the texture paths come from vanilla.
