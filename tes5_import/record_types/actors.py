    #
    #   TES4 (UESP Oblivion:Aggression / Oblivion:Disposition): an actor attacks
    #   a target when disposition(actor→target) < aggression - 5. Starting
    #   disposition toward the player ≈ the actor's Personality, shifted by
    #   race/faction reactions; "enemies are programmed to have NEGATIVE
    #   dispositions towards you." aggression <= 5 never attacks; >= 106 attacks
    #   anyone regardless of disposition.
    #
    #   TES5 replaces the 0-100 disposition scalar with a discrete combat
    #   reaction (Enemy/Neutral/Friend/Ally) and makes aggression a TIER that
    #   says which reactions it will attack: 0 attacks nobody unprovoked, 1
    #   "Aggressive" attacks only Enemies (a neutral player is not attacked — the
    #   actor merely RETALIATES when hit), 2 "VeryAggressive" attacks Neutrals on
    #   sight too, 3 "Frenzied" attacks everyone incl. allies.
    #
    # THE KEY POINT: aggression is not "how hostile is this actor", it is "WHICH
    # REACTION TIER does it attack".  Who it is hostile TO lives in the faction
    # graph, in BOTH games.  UESP Skyrim:NPCs#Aggression states it directly:
    # "Together with the FACTION RELATIONSHIP COMBAT MODIFIER this governs
    # whether the NPC initiates combat", and defines
    #   0 Unaggressive  attacks nobody unless provoked
    #   1 Aggressive    attacks ENEMIES on sight
    #   2 VeryAggressive attacks enemies AND NEUTRAL on sight
    #   3 Frenzied      attacks anybody on sight
    # The player is a NEUTRAL to anyone with no relation to PlayerFaction, so
    # tier 2 is the line between "hunts its faction enemies" and "hunts you".
    #
    # TES4 expresses the same thing per-target: attack when
    # disposition(actor→target) < aggression - 5, where disposition is
    # Personality plus the FACTION reactions toward that specific target
    # (UESP Oblivion:Disposition).  Worked through for Nehrim's Benno, a dog in
    # MarauderFaction + BanditFaction with aggr=30, Personality=10:
    #
    #   Benno → a bandit : 10 + (-100) = -90 < 25   → attacks   (Enemy)
    #   Benno → player   : 10 +     0  =  10        → no faction relation at all
    #
    # MarauderFaction and BanditFaction relate ONLY to each other (-100) and to
    # CreatureFaction (+20); NEITHER has any relation to PlayerFaction.  Benno
    # is aggressive toward MARAUDERS, not toward you — and Oblivion's own
    # CreatureDog carries byte-identical data, which is why UESP lists Dog under
    # "Aggressive Animals" while the dog still never mauls the player on sight.
    #
    # That is the whole bug: collapsing a per-target rule onto one global tier
    # and then resolving it against the player.  Any actor whose hostility is
    # expressed purely as faction relations must land on tier 1 — the faction
    # graph (converted faithfully into XNAM Group Combat Reaction) then does the
    # targeting exactly as it does in vanilla Skyrim, whose own horses, deer,
    # elk, cows, goats, foxes and sabre cats are ALL Aggression 0 for the same
    # reason.
    #
    # NOTE: gating tier 2 on "does a faction make the player an enemy" was tried
    # and is WRONG.  Oblivion's wolves/bears/trolls/mountain lions sit in
    # CreatureFaction, which has no PlayerFaction relation either, so that rule
    # dropped every predator to tier 1 and made the wilderness passive.  Skyrim
    # separates these two cases with AIDT's Aggro Radius fields (EncWolf is
    # Aggression 0 but carries aggroRadiusBehavior=1, attack radius 1500) —
    # fields TES4's AIDT does not have at all (xEdit wbDefinitionsTES4: AIDT is
    # Aggression/Confidence/Energy/Responsibility/Services/Teaches/MaxTraining
    # only).  The discriminator therefore has to be reconstructed; see
    # _predator_attack_radius below.
    # The rule below is calibrated, not guessed.  UESP Oblivion:Animals draws
    # the exact distinction we need for the dogs: randomly generated dogs "are
    # Bandit or marauder dogs ... that are hostile towards you, ALTHOUGH THEY

    # is precisely TES5 tier 1; "on sight" is tier 2.
    #
    # Two terms decide it:
    #   * Prey membership — vanilla's marker for harmless.  Its 43 members are
    #     horses, deer and sheep, several at aggression 100, so no aggression
    #     threshold can exclude them (this is what broke earlier attempts).
    #   * The attack MARGIN, (aggr-5) - disposition: how decisively the TES4
    #     rule fires.  Measured across Oblivion's creatures, known predators
    #     have a median margin of 48 and tame animals -47, while Benno scores

    # Ally and Friend were previously swapped here (3 written for Ally, 2 for
    # Friend).  Confirmed two ways: the xEdit definition above, and a census of
    # Skyrim.esm where 160 of 200 faction SELF-relations use 2 — a faction is
    # Ally to itself, never merely Friend.
    #
    # Why the swap was a live bug and not cosmetic: Ally is the tier that makes
    # members ASSIST each other into combat (UESP Skyrim:Factions — reaction
    # combines with aggression and ASSISTANCE to decide who joins a fight).
    # Oblivion's CG data has BladesCG → MythicDawnCG at +100, which in TES4 is
    # only a disposition bonus ("these people like each other"); TES4 starts the
    # intro fight with StartCombat, not with the faction graph.  Converted with
    # the swap, that +100 became Ally, so the Emperor's guards assisted the
    # Mythic Dawn and turned on the player — who is a Neutral — instead of on
    # the assassins.
    #
    # Reaction thresholds also tightened: TES4 dispositions are a 0-100 SCALAR
    # that shifts how much an actor likes a target, whereas TES5's Ally is a
    # hard "fight alongside them" contract.  Reserving Ally for a faction's
    # relation to ITSELF (Oblivion's universal idiom for "we are one group",
    # 147 of 660 relations) keeps the assist graph vanilla-shaped; a positive
    # relation to a DIFFERENT faction means "friendly", which is Friend.  This
    # is what stops any converted plugin from silently wiring bystanders into
    # someone else's fight.
