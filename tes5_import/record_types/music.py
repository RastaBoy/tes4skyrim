"""MUSC / MUST — Skyrim's music system, built from TES4's folder categories.

TES4 has no music records at all.  Oblivion's engine scans Data/Music/<Category>/
and shuffles what it finds; CELL.XCMT and WRLD.SNAM carry only a 3-value enum
{0 Default, 1 Public, 2 Dungeon} (xEdit wbMusicEnum).  So the conversion is:

    the FOLDER a track sits in  ->  a MUSC music type
    each track file             ->  a MUST music track
    XCMT / SNAM enum value      ->  which MUSC a cell / worldspace points at

Structure follows wbDefinitionsTES5.pas and a real Skyrim.esm dump:

  MUSC: EDID, FNAM flags(u32), PNAM {Priority u16, Ducking u16}, WNAM fade(f32),
        TNAM array of MUST FormIDs
  MUST: EDID, CNAM track type(u32), FLTV duration(f32), DNAM fade-out(f32),
        ANAM track filename

Vanilla census (Skyrim.esm, 258 MUST / 50 MUSC) drove the shape:
  * 240 Single Track, 13 Palette, 5 Silent Track -- so single tracks are the
    norm and this writes those plus one Silent Track for a silence source.
  * Only 1 record carries LNAM loop data, 10 carry FNAM cue points and 10 a
    BNAM finale, so all three are omitted rather than invented.
  * 210 of 240 ANAMs start with a leading backslash; the 30 that do not load
    identically.  We follow the majority form.

# TES4 Data/Music/<folder> -> how that category behaves in Skyrim.
#
# 🛑 PNAM PRIORITY IS INVERTED FROM THE OBVIOUS READING: **LOWER WINS.**
# Measured across all 50 vanilla MUSC in Skyrim.esm, the two bands are cleanly
# separated with no overlap:
#
#     INTERRUPT types (MUSCombat, MUSSpecial*, MUSDiscovery*,
#                      MUSReveal, MUSReward, MUSStinger, MUSDread)   1 .. 3
#     BED / ambient   (MUSExplore*, MUSDungeon*, MUSTavern*,
#                      MUSTownTest, MUSCastle)                      47 .. 55
#
# So combat sits at 1-2 and the persistent exploration bed at 49-50.  An
# earlier version of this table had it backwards (explore=20, battle=6) on the
# assumption that "higher priority = more important"; that put the ambient bed
# BELOW vanilla's `_NONE` placeholder (priority 5) and no exploration music
# ever played.  Never renumber these without re-running the vanilla census.
#
# `Battle` has NO record-level source in TES4 -- Oblivion's engine picks combat
# music by folder name alone -- so its MUSC is authored here.  That is the one
# unavoidable authored value; every other category is a direct folder mapping.
#
# Vanilla ducking for the ambient tier is 0 and for combat 10000 (=100.00 dB
# via wbDiv(100)), which is how combat silences the bed rather than mixing
