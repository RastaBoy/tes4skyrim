# SKY SCALE MUST NOT BE DERIVED FROM SKY COLOUR.
#
# Sky Scale is a tonemapper term applied to the sky, and in Skyrim's sky pixel
# shader it lands as an ADDITIVE floor:
#
#     psout.Color.xyz = input.Color.xyz * baseColor.xyz + skyScale
#
# (Community Shaders `Sky.hlsl`; the constant is PParams.y, set in
# BSSkyShader.cpp as fInvFrameBufferRange * [sky+0xE4] and forced to 0 for
# moons/sunglare.)  Oblivion's sky shader has NO additive term at all — its
# dome pixel shader is literally `mov r0, v0` — so nothing in a TES4 weather
# should drive this.
#
# The previous revision ramped Sky Scale off the weather's own sky luminance.
# That scales an ADDITIVE floor in proportion to the MULTIPLICATIVE colour,
# i.e. a feedback loop: brighter sky -> bigger floor -> brighter sky.  It is
# invisible to any per-field range check, which is why every clamping pass
# missed it.  Measured on the shipped output, it made our Sky Scale a near
# deterministic function of sky brightness where vanilla's is only loosely
# related:
#
#     SkyUpper vs SkyScale   vanilla r = +0.407   ours r = +0.885
#     Horizon  vs SkyScale   vanilla r = +0.374   ours r = +0.819
#
# What vanilla actually keys it off, over the 332 weather/time rows that
# resolve an imagespace: classification x time explains R2 = 0.434, sky
# luminance only R2 = 0.166.  So this is a LOOKUP on two authored TES4
# fields (DATA.Classification and the time slot), with no colour dependence —
# which also makes it generalise to plugins we have never seen.

# UpperLumClamp is 1.0 (the bottom of its 1.0..1.3 span), so nearly every
# weather got White = 0.88 — the bottom DECILE of vanilla — a lowered white
# point, with bloom threshold and receive-bloom simultaneously mapped
# bloom-heavy.  The result read as an overexposed camera.
#
# The fix anchors on medians instead: a median TES4 input lands EXACTLY on
# the vanilla per-slot median (measured over the 213 imagespaces vanilla
# weathers reference), and authored deviation from the TES4 median moves the
# output away from the vanilla median by `gain`, clamped to the vanilla

#
# THE PALETTE AND THE BLOOM ARE TWO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.  Getting that wrong
# is what the previous revision did, and it cost a lot of in-game rounds.
#
# What the old code did: compute the PLUGIN's median luminance per slot and
# per TIME, scale every colour so that median lands on vanilla's, then cap at
# vanilla's p90.  It did stop the bloom — but by crushing the whole palette,
# and it produced two clearly wrong results in game:
#
#   * NIGHTS WENT BRIGHT BLUE.  Oblivion authors night at 7-12% of day
#     luminance.  A PER-TIME factor scaled night up 1.9-3.1x while scaling day
#     down 0.62-0.70x, so the authored day/night ratio became 22-55% — the
#     night sky stopped being dark and became a saturated blue.
#   * THE DAY SKY WENT DULL.  Authored SkyUpper day median 136.5 was pushed to
#     84.3, because the vanilla median it aimed at is pulled down by storms,
#     dungeons and Sovngarde rather than describing a clear afternoon.
#
# The measurement that settles it: the two populations AGREE at the bottom and
# only diverge at the top (all sky/light slots x times, TES4 vs the 177
# vanilla weathers):
#
#     percentile     p50    p75    p90    p95    p99
#     TES4          76.9  154.6  204.6  243.1  255.0
#     vanilla       83.8  125.8  168.0  193.5  220.3
#
# So Oblivion's colours are NOT broadly hot.  Only the top ~20% is, which is
# exactly the part that crosses the tonemapper's bright-pass threshold
# (`max(scene - BloomThreshold, 0) * BloomScale`, verified against Oblivion's
# own HDR005.pso and Skyrim's ISHDR.hlsl).  A uniform scale therefore darkens
# midtones to fix highlights.
#
# What we do instead: leave everything below the knee EXACTLY AS AUTHORED and
# remap knee..255 into knee..ceiling, scaling all three channels by the same
# factor so hue is untouched.  Because the curve is a pure function of one
# colour's luminance, it has no time axis and no plugin-population term — the
# authored day/night ratio survives bit-for-bit (measured: 0.073 authored ->
# 0.073 through the knee, against 0.253 through the old code), and a weather
# converts the same way regardless of what else is in the plugin.
#
# THE SUN SLOT IS A GENUINE OUTLIER and gets its own, much harder knee.  Its
# TES4 day median is 193.4 against vanilla's 42.5 — 4.55x, where no other slot
# exceeds 1.7x.  In Skyrim the sun's apparent brightness comes from the glare
# pass and the imagespace, not from this colour, so a near-white disc here is
# a bloom source with nothing to justify it.

#
# The engine loads the HARDCODED `Meshes\Sky\Clouds.nif` (string at
# SkyrimSE.exe 0x169a538).  Our converted `tes4\sky\clouds.nif` is NEVER
# used: CLMT has no cloud-mesh field at all -- its MODL is the NIGHT SKY
# (stars) mesh, per wbRecord(CLMT) in wbDefinitionsTES5.pas and
# TESClimate::nightSky in CommonLibSSE-NG.  An earlier revision assumed we
# shipped the dome and capped the plan at two layers on that basis; that was
# wrong, and it put both sheets on the two smallest shapes in the mesh.
#
# Measured UV spans of the shipped 29-shape dome:
#
#     L11 09_CDTop            U 1.58  V 1.58    ~1:1 projection
#     L27 14_CDLower          U 2.27  V 2.27    ~1:1 projection
#     L 8 07_CDDome_Horizon   U 6.00            tiles 6x around the horizon
#     L 9/10 (_E/_W)          U 2.40            same band, split
#     L15-26 12_/13_CDHorizon_*  V 0.25         narrow V-sliced STRIPS
#     L28 15_CDFog            U 21.00           tiles 21x, horizon wash
#
# Oblivion authors its two sheets as SINGLE FULL-DOME PROJECTIONS
# (`CloudDome:0` 3.35x3.35 and `CloudDome:1` 2.97x2.97, both spanning 0..90
# degrees elevation), so **11 and 27 are the only structural matches**.  Any
# heavily U-tiled shape turns a full-sky sheet into a repeating horizon band,
# which is exactly what was observed in game: a variant using 8/9/10 put all
# the cloud around the horizon instead of over the sky.
#
# Vanilla confirms the roles by shipping DEDICATED ART per layer:
#     L11  SkyrimClouds01 / SkyrimCloudsLower0*   (full-dome sheets)
#     L27  SkyrimClouds01 / SkyrimCloudsLower03   (full-dome sheets)

#     L28  SkyrimCloudsFill       156 of 157      (purpose-made wash)
# We have no strip or wash art, so those layers have nothing correct to put
# on them and stay empty.
#

# strips + fog wash, on 3/6/11, on 11/27 swapped, and on 11/27 alone:

    """Rewrite every WTHR SNAM from its TES4 SOUN id to the SNDR descriptor.

    TES5 weather sounds reference a sound DESCRIPTOR, not a SOUN: xEdit's
    shared wbWeatherSounds is `wbFormIDCK('Sound', [SNDR, SOUN, NULL])`, and a
    census of the real Skyrim.esm (SSE) shows 11 of the 12 distinct weather
    sound targets are SNDR.  The single SOUN target (AMBWindLightLP, 0x12EA2)
    is a LEGACY record that still carries its own FNAM + SNDD payload, so it
    is self-describing.

    Ours are not.  convert_SOUN emits `EDID + OBND + SDSC` only — all the
    audio data lives on the companion SNDR — so a weather pointing at one
    hands the engine a descriptor-shaped read with no descriptor behind it.
    That is what produced the wrong-sound symptom (fire crackling and animal
    noises in open Nehrim countryside): the weather bed is not the sound the
    plugin authored, it is whatever the mis-typed dereference lands on.

    WTHR is written in Phase 2, before Phase 3 creates the descriptors, so
    convert_WTHR stores the SOUN id and this resolves it — the same
    placeholder-then-patch approach actors.patch_actor_sounds uses for CSDI
    and items.patch_sound_descriptor_slots for the DOOR/LIGH/ACTI/CONT slots.
    Allocating during Phase 2 instead would shift every later generated
    FormID.

    *own_soun_ids* is the low-24 id set of the SOUN records THIS plugin
    converts; anything outside it (an override build's master-owned records,
    already holding real SNDR ids) is left untouched, exactly as
    patch_sound_descriptor_slots does.

    A slot whose SOUN produced no descriptor is DROPPED rather than left
    pointing at the wrong record type — 63 of the 84 vanilla weathers ship no
    sound at all, so an empty sound list is the vanilla-normal state.
