"""Placed leveled creatures: TES4 `REFR → LVLC` becomes TES5 `ACHR → NPC_ → LVLN`.

Oblivion spawns a leveled creature by placing the leveled list itself: a plain
REFR whose NAME is an LVLC (8005 of them in Oblivion.esm).  Skyrim has no such
thing.  Its engine only instantiates actors from ACHR records, and an ACHR's
NAME must be a concrete NPC_ (`wbFormIDCk(NAME, 'Base', [NPC_])` in
wbDefinitionsTES5.pas).  A REFR pointing at an LVLN is inert — the record loads,
nothing ever spawns.  That is why converted hand-placed actors show up in-game
while every leveled creature is missing.

Vanilla Skyrim's equivalent is a three-record chain, verified against a
Skyrim.esm dump (LCharDwarvenCenturion 0010FCE5 → LvlDwarvenCenturion 0010FCE6):

    ACHR ──NAME──▶ NPC_ "shell" ──TPLT──▶ LVLN

The shell NPC_ carries no real data of its own; its ACBS Template Flags tell the
engine to pull every field from whichever actor the LVLN rolls at spawn time.
508 of Skyrim's 527 LVLNs have exactly one such shell; 10504/10504 of its ACHRs
point at an NPC_ and zero point at an LVLN.

This module runs before the CELL/WRLD group builders and does two things:

  1. mints one shell NPC_ per LVLC that is actually placed by a REFR, and
  2. rewrites those REFR record dicts into ACHR records aimed at the shell,
     moving them from ``by_type['REFR']`` to ``by_type['ACHR']``.

The rewritten dicts keep every field convert_ACHR reads (EditorID, XESP, XSCL,
Pos/Rot, ParentCELL/ParentWRLD, RecordFlags), so no other pass needs to change.
