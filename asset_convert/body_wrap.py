"""Body-wrap armor fitting: exact fit onto the Skyrim body without clipping.

The FK animation retarget (skin_retarget Phase B) poses Oblivion armor ~90%
of the way to the Skyrim rest pose and is locally SMOOTH (it is ordinary
skinning), but it lands near — not on — the Skyrim body: armor floats or
sinks by 0.5-2.5 units, which is exactly the clipping seen in game.

This module measures that FK error EXACTLY and cancels it:

BUILD (offline, `python -m asset_convert.body_wrap`):
  1. Load the Oblivion body part meshes (upperbody/lowerbody/hand/foot AND
     head+ears) in T-pose — the surfaces all Oblivion armor was modelled
     around.  The HEAD group (2026-08-23) is what lets helmets, hoods and
     converted hair be fitted by measurement instead of the hand-tuned
     ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS constants they used to fall back to; its fit is the
     tightest of any group (surface residual 0.013 vs the body's 0.020) and it
     corrects a real FK error of mean 4.4 / max 10.4 units.  Its ICP is seeded
     from the OB<->SK head UV correspondence, without which the fit cannot
     reach the Skyrim crown at all (see _uv_head_seed).
  2. FK-pose a copy with the very same retarget the armor gets (fkp).
  3. Fit the posed body EXACTLY onto the real Skyrim body surfaces — BOTH
     weight-slider targets (malebody_0 AND malebody_1, hands, feet):
     iterative closest-point projection with
     normal-agreement filtering, the per-step displacement smoothed over the
     welded mesh graph (topology-aware — never bleeds between the legs), plus
     limb-segment length rescaling so wrists/ankles land right (dst).
  4. Save src (T-pose), fkp, dst0/dst1, triangles, and per-vertex
     skin-weight bone centroids to generated/body_wrap_{gender}.npz.  The
     dual dst targets give converted armor true _0/_1 weight-morph variants
     (vanilla ARMA weight-slider convention).

APPLY (runtime, called from skin_retarget.retarget_skin_to_skyrim):
  1. Run the normal FK deform (unchanged — provides the smooth base).
  2. For every armor vertex, interpolate the correction field
     delta = dst - fkp from the FK-posed body surface: Gaussian blend over
     the K nearest body triangles (distance + skin-weight bone-centroid
     gating + wrong-side penalty), evaluating each candidate's delta at the
     closest surface point via barycentric interpolation.
  3. v' = v_fk + blended delta.  Near the body this lands armor at its
     authored clearance from the Skyrim body (measured error dmean ~0);
     away from the body the normalized blend extrapolates the regional
     correction as a constant — replacing the old hand-tuned
     ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS drift compensation entirely.

Because the correction is a smooth, slowly-varying translation field, armor
keeps FK's local mesh quality (no crumpling, no vertex explosions, UV-seam
twins move identically), while the residual body clipping is cancelled.

# Head map: exact UV correspondence between the OB and SK heads
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The wrap field's ICP head fit CANNOT place head gear correctly, and the
# reason is geometric, not tuning.  The Oblivion skull is 19.2 units tall
# (z 106.84..126.04); the Skyrim one is 22.5 (z 109.33..131.85).  ICP has no
# geometry to project onto the extra 3.3 units, so it stretches what it has
# and leaves the Skyrim crown and upper-back skull up to 5.2 units uncovered
# (measured: the fitted head tops out at z 130.8 vs the real 131.85, and its
# back profile over z 120..128 reads 8.8/8.8/7.5/-6.1 against Skyrim's
# 9.9/10.0/9.2/8.1).  That uncovered upper-back skull is EXACTLY where hair
# and helmets sit, which is why the back of the head poked through them.
#
# Both heads are heads: they share the FaceGen UV layout, landmark for
# landmark.  Measured on the vanilla pair --
#     crown    OB (0.499, 0.053) <-> SK (0.502, 0.044)
#     back     OB (0.499, 0.506) <-> SK (0.502, 0.464)
#     nose tip OB (0.400, 0.003) <-> SK (0.437, 0.010)
# -- so sampling the Skyrim head at each Oblivion head vertex's UV gives an
# EXACT correspondence rather than a nearest-point guess.  It reproduces the
# real Skyrim head to mean 0.37 / p95 0.89 units INCLUDING the crown
# (z 131.68 vs the real 131.85), and it accounts for ears, eyes and nose by
# identity because the UV layout is what pins those features.
#
# The correspondence is used ONLY to SEED the head group's ICP fit in
# build_field.  It must NEVER be applied to geometry directly: the two heads
# correspond topologically but are wildly non-isometric locally, so the raw
# map stretches the head's OWN edges by up to 2045% (79.9% of edges over 15%),
# and a correction field built from it mangles whatever rides it -- measured
# on converted hair as 34.01% of edges distorted >15%, max 108%.  Seeding ICP
# instead keeps the field the smooth, slowly-varying translation field armor
# depends on: 2.51% of edges >15%, max 40%, while the fit's worst
# back-of-head shortfall drops from 5.2 units to 0.89.
