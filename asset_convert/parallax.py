"""Carry Oblivion's parallax across to Skyrim.

Oblivion switches parallax on per shape with
``NiTexturingProperty.apply_mode == APPLY_HILIGHT2 (4)`` and keeps the height
field in the DIFFUSE's ALPHA channel.  Skyrim wants it as a separate greyscale
texture in slot 3 (``<name>_p.dds``) with shader type 3 (Heightmap) and
``SLSF1_Parallax`` set.

Two questions decide whether a shape is converted, and they need two different
sources:

  * the MESH FLAG answers "did the author want parallax here" — that is
    authored intent and is never guessed at;
  * the TEXTURE answers "is there any height data to carry" — measured over
    Nehrim's full 12,437-mesh set: 2359 flagged shapes on **130 distinct
    diffuse textures**, of which only **38** actually hold one.  67 are DXT1
    with no alpha channel at all (vanilla Oblivion architecture sets the flag
    and ships no data, so Oblivion itself renders no parallax there either),
    14 are flat, 6 are too coarsely quantised to be a surface, 1 is a
    soft-edged mask, 1 a transparency cutout, and 3 name a file that does not
    exist.

Both must say yes.  With the flag alone we would write an empty height map and
switch the shader for two thirds of the textures, and a parallax shape with no
usable height renders as a visibly swimming surface.

Per SHAPE the yield is much better than per texture — the textures that do
carry height are the ones used everywhere: **1495 of the 2359 flagged shapes
(63%) convert**, the rest are left flat.

**This never runs by default.**  Verified in game: a correctly built parallax
shape swims in vanilla SSE, and the SSE Parallax Shader Fix did not help.  It
renders correctly under Community Shaders and under ENB, so the output requires
one of those — which the converter cannot detect, hence the opt-in switch.

The alpha classification here follows the one in the author's own
TES4AutoParallaxer, whose thresholds were tuned against this very content.

# `normalise_height` is not a fixed curve, it is a fit onto a MEASURED property
# of its input (the share of area within +/-FLAT_BAND of the median).  Run it
# LAST, on the pixels that actually ship, and it still lands on
# TARGET_FLAT_SHARE whatever the halving and the blur did to the field.
#
# Halving is also a straight win on the slowest step: `encode_bc4_dds` is pure

# pixels is a quarter of the blocks.

# half-width; sigma is a third of it, the usual truncation.

# How much of a surface must sit within +/-`FLAT_BAND` levels of its own
# median: the shape difference between a hand-tuned height map and Nehrim's raw
# alpha, stated so that no outlier can move it.
#
# 🔴 THE MEASURE THIS REPLACED WAS WRONG, and it took the author pointing at a
# rendered map to see it.  "Share of texels in the bottom third of min..max"
# takes its threshold from the EXTREMES, so a couple of bright texels stretch
# the range and drag the whole surface into the deep band.
# `leyawiinmetalstrip03` — a flat plate with two rivets — scored 94.2% "deep",
# while 93.7% of its area sits within +/-20 of its median, p95 is 83, and the
# amplitude of 146 comes almost entirely from the rivets (p99 jumps to 132).
#
# Recomputed outlier-proof over the same 56 pairs (`temp/parallax_pairs.csv`):
#
#                                hand-tuned   Nehrim
#     deep third (min..max)            12.1     39.1  <- what was calibrated on
#     deep third (p05..p95)            25.8     37.9  <- honest, barely splits
#     share within +/-20 of median     63.2     36.6  <- clean AND robust
#
# The middle row is the finding: once the range is made robust, the deep-third
# figure stops separating the two populations at all.  Only the band measure
# does, and it says the same thing the eye does — the hand-tuned wall is a flat
# face with narrow mortar grooves, Nehrim's is restless everywhere.
#
# 🔴 Scaling and shifting cannot produce this.  Shifting is linear and moves
# the median with the body; scaling DOES change an absolute band, which is why
# `target_range` carries part of the correction, but reaching 63% by scaling
# alone would mean an amplitude far below the ~150 the hand-tuned maps ship at.
# The rest has to come from a curve.
#
# The target itself is the median of the WHOLE reference corpus, 3631 height
# fields rather than the 56 paired ones:
#
#     both folders   p05 34.7   p25 49.0   median 63.3   p75 73.4   p95 84.8
#       folder A     p05 49.9   p25 62.5   median 69.6   p75 76.1   p95 85.7
#       folder B     p05 29.3   p25 43.0   median 51.3   p75 66.6   p95 83.1
#
# 🔴 Read the two folder rows before touching this number.  The same author
# normalises to 69.6% in one set and 51.3% in the other — the SAME split that
# made the amplitude cap dangerous (medians 145 and 153 there).  63 is the
# pooled median and sits between them, which is the honest choice for a target;
# calibrating on either folder alone would land 6-12 points off.
#
# And the spread is wide on purpose: this is a central tendency, not a law.
# Half the reference corpus sits below 63%, so the target says "as flat as a
# typical hand-made map", not "flatter than every hand-made map".  It is a
# CURVE TARGET only — as a DETECTOR the same figure fails badly, see
# `DEFAULT_MAX_RANGE`.
#
# 🔵 Set to 0.68 rather than the pooled 63.3 on the author's in-game verdict:
# "the maps are OK, they could go a touch flatter".  0.68 sits between the
# pooled median and folder A's 69.6 — still inside the hand-tuned population,
# in the direction of the author's own newer set.
#
# What that buys is bounded, and measured: over the 38 maps the median flat
# share goes 63.4% -> 65.4%, and it does not move again at 0.70, 0.75 or 0.80.
# `_MIN_BODY_LEVELS` — not the target — is what stops the curve there.  So this

#
# 🔴 `x**g` — the curve this replaced — CANNOT do this job, which is worth
# recording so it is not tried again.  It compresses one END of the range, so
# the share inside a band around the median is not even monotone in g:
# measured over all 38 maps, 21 of them DIP before they rise as g falls, so a
# bisection has nothing to bisect on.  And inside the range its own
# posterisation floor allows (g >= 0.63 at amplitude 255) the median share only
# moves 53% -> 56%.  The 63% target is out of reach for that family entirely.
#
# This curve works on the DISTANCE from the median instead:
#
#     y = med + sign(d) * D * (|d| / D) ** p          d = v - med
#
# with D taken per side, so `lo` -> `lo` and `hi` -> `hi` exactly and the
# amplitude is untouched.  p > 1 presses the body together and steepens the
# tails — a flat face with narrow deep grooves.  Two properties `x**g` lacked:
#
#   * MONOTONE in p by construction.  Raising p moves every texel weakly
#     CLOSER to the median, so the share inside any band can only grow.  That
#     is what makes the bisection valid.
#   * It cannot punch holes.  Its steepest slope is p, at the ENDS, where
#     `x**g` had UNBOUNDED slope at 0 — that unbounded slope is what turned
#     cave04 into grey plateaus with black holes punched through it.  The
#     linear compression that follows scales even that down by `f`.
#
# The risk this family DOES carry is the opposite one: too large a p presses
# the body dead flat, and a face with no relief left is as wrong as a restless
# one.  So the ceiling is derived from the body rather than chosen: after the
# curve and the linear step, the +/-FLAT_BAND band must still span at least
# `_MIN_BODY_LEVELS` distinct output levels.
#
# 21 is the AUTHORED floor, not a round number.  Over all 3631 hand-tuned

#
#     min 21   p05 25   median 41   p95 41   max 41
#
# A +/-20 band spans 41 levels, so the median hand-tuned map uses EVERY one of
# them and not one map in the corpus drops below 21.  Holding a corrected map
# to that floor means it is never left with a poorer face than the poorest map
# the author shipped.  (The guard measures the band's WIDTH, which is an upper
# bound on occupied levels — taking the floor of the reference population
# rather than a comfortable round number is what pays for that optimism.)
#

# Amplitude a height field may span before it is compressed, and the ONE
# number in this module that was calibrated rather than chosen.
#
# A hand-made height map works in BOTH engines: the user's own maps are
# authored for Oblivion, rebuilt from the normal maps and hand-tuned, and they
# render correctly in Skyrim too.  So a mod shipping good maps must come
# through this conversion untouched, and only Oblivion/Nehrim's own raw alphas
# get corrected.  Calibrated on 56 PAIRS — the same texture, hand-tuned on one
# side and Nehrim's original on the other (`temp/parallax_pairs.csv`):
#
#     hand-tuned : min 130  p25 144  median 146  p75 147  max 148
#     Nehrim     : min  95  p25 159  median 203  p75 254  max 255
#
#     cap 148 -> 100% of the hand-tuned set untouched, 83% of Nehrim's fixed
#
# Then TWO whole reference folders were measured, not just the paired subset,
# and they do not agree with each other:
#
#     folder A  1738 height fields   median 145   max 148
#     folder B  1893 height fields   median 153   max 156
#
# The same author normalises to ~145 in one set and ~153 in the other, so
# "amplitude below X" is a CONVENTION test, not a law.  A cap of 150 — which
# folder A alone appeared to justify — would have compressed all 1893 maps in
# folder B.  That is exactly the damage this constant exists to prevent, and
# it was caught only because a second folder got checked.
#
# Nehrim's over-deep textures start at 159, and the ones that actually drew
# the complaint are 169 and up (`wandb` 171).  The two populations are barely
# fifteen steps apart, so the threshold goes in the MIDDLE of that gap: 163
# clears folder B's ceiling by seven and still catches everything from 169 up.
# No texture on either side falls between 156 and 169, so the exact value
# inside that window changes no behaviour — it only buys margin.
#
# 🔴 Treat this as FRAGILE.  It separates two populations ~15 steps apart, and
# a mod that normalises to 170 WOULD be compressed.
#
# But it is the BEST AVAILABLE, and that was measured rather than assumed.
# The obvious upgrade candidate is the tone-curve figure — whichever one is in
# use — and as a DETECTOR it is worse.  Measured with the deep-third share over
# 3631 good height fields vs Nehrim's 56:
#
#     amplitude   > 163      keeps 100% of good, catches 73% of bad
#     deep share  >  20%     keeps  88%,          catches 80%
#     deep share  >  40%     keeps  98%,          catches 48%
#     amp>163 OR deep> 25%   keeps  93%,          catches 92%
#     amp>163 OR deep> 50%   keeps  98%,          catches 80%
#
# Amplitude is the only rule that keeps ALL of them.  The reason is in the
# spread: the hand-tuned deep share ran 0..94% (median 6.3), so some of those
# maps look legitimately almost black and no threshold can tell them from
# Nehrim's.  Their amplitude, by contrast, stops dead at 156.
#
# That measurement is also the one the outlier problem hit hardest — a share
# taken off min..max is exactly what a pair of bright rivets distorts, so the
# 0..94% spread above overstates how dark the hand-tuned set really is (see
# `TARGET_FLAT_SHARE`).  The conclusion survives it: the band measure separates
# the two populations 63% against 37%, which is a clean split for a CURVE
# TARGET but nowhere near the "keeps 100% of good" a detector has to manage.
# Do not swap the detector for the curve's figure; it has been tried twice.
#
# What this is NOT: the median's distance from mid-grey.  That was the obvious
# theory and the same 56 pairs refute it — hand-tuned medians scatter 86..132
# and Nehrim's overlap them, so any tolerance that spares the good maps also
# spares half the bad ones (tol 40: 96% of theirs kept, only 53% of ours
# corrected).  Do not reintroduce a centring step without new evidence.
DEFAULT_MAX_RANGE = 163

# Where a corrected field's median is moved to.  Also measured on the 56
# pairs: the hand-tuned medians sit in a TIGHT band and Nehrim's do not.
#
#     hand-tuned : min 85  p25 102  median 117  p75 126  max 145
#     Nehrim     : min  0  p25  63  median  93  p75 138  max 216
#     in 100..135:  73% of the hand-tuned set, 23% of Nehrim's
#
# 117 is the middle of that band — just under mid-grey, not on it.
#
# 🔴 This is a CORRECTION, never a DETECTOR.  Whether a map needs work is
# decided by amplitude alone; the medians of the two sets overlap far too
# much to tell them apart (any tolerance sparing 96% of the good maps also
# spares 53% of Nehrim's).  So the shift is applied ONLY to a field the
# amplitude cap already condemned — a map that passes the cap is returned
# untouched, median and all.
TARGET_MEDIAN = 117

# How dark a field's median may be before it is corrected FOR THAT ALONE.
#
# This is the second detector, and it exists because the band measure answered
# the `durchgangD` question with a clear NO.  That texture — a practically
# black wall, median 17, amplitude 158 — reads as **89.2% flat** on the new
# measure, and correctly so: it IS flat, just parked entirely at the bottom.
# Restlessness and off-centredness are two different defects and the curve
# only fixes the first.
#
# The mechanism is why it matters.  A parallax shader offsets along the view
# vector by (height - neutral), so a field whose whole surface sits near 0 does
# not render as "deep" — it renders as a CONSTANT view-dependent UV shift, i.e.
# the texture slides across the wall as the camera moves.  That is the same
# swimming artefact an empty height map produces, which is exactly why an empty
# one is refused outright (see the module docstring).
#
# 🔴 Centring was rejected once, and reintroducing it needed new evidence.
# The old refutation stands for what it tested: a TOLERANCE AROUND MID-GREY,
# measured on the 56 pairs, where the medians overlap so badly that sparing 96%
# of the good maps also spares 53% of Nehrim's.  This is a different rule — a
# ONE-SIDED FLOOR — and the evidence is the full 3631-map reference corpus
# rather than 56 of them:
#
#     median level   hand-tuned : min  52  p05  94  median 125  p95 175
#                    Nehrim     : min  17  p05  31  median 105  p95 169
#
#     floor < 45   touches 0 of 3631 hand-tuned (0.00%), catches 4 Nehrim maps
#     floor < 60   touches 3 of 3631 (0.08%)
#
# NOTHING the author shipped is darker than 52.  The four maps this catches are
# `durchgangD` (17), `durchgangA` (31), `decked` (32) and `bodend` (36) — the
# exact set that sits just under the amplitude threshold at 153..159 and was
# left shipping untouched.  45 sits in the middle of the empty gap between 36
# and 52, the same way `DEFAULT_MAX_RANGE` sits in the gap between 156 and 169.
#
# What a map caught by THIS rule alone gets is deliberately minimal: the
# re-centring shift and nothing else.  No compression, no tone curve.  A pure
# translation cannot damage relief — every level, every gradient and every gap
# survives it — so the fix reaches the defect and stops there.  The amplitude
# detector remains the only thing that may compress a field.
MIN_MEDIAN = 45

# Rejected by measurement, so it is not tried again: clamping the tails.  The
# theory was that Nehrim's amplitude comes from a few extreme texels a p1..p99
# clamp could shave.  It does not — core(p5..p95)/full is 0.68 for Nehrim and
# 0.54 for the hand-tuned set, i.e. Nehrim's depth sits in the BODY of the
# surface and the hand-tuned maps have relatively MORE tail.  A p1..p99 clamp
# alone leaves Nehrim's amplitude at 83% and brings only 39% under the cap.

# drop it below 148 and the conversion starts flattening maps a modder built

#
# `target_range` is how far a condemned map is taken, and it is free to go
# lower.  It exists because measurement failed to explain the eye: Nehrim's
# `wandb` corrected to amplitude 150 still reads as too strong in game while
# the hand-tuned version at 143 reads as right — and neither amplitude (5%
# apart), steepness (ours is 0.70x theirs in UV space) nor a material depth
# parameter (shader type 3 has none, and Community Shaders exposes only

    `strength`   an extra uniform factor on top, 1.0 for none.  Reach for the
                 cap first: a uniform factor is set by the worst offender and
                 flattens the mild textures by the same amount, which throws
                 away authored relief (a plaster wall is meant to be flatter

    `target_range`  how deep a CORRECTED field is taken; 0 means "to
                 max_range".  Separate from the detector on purpose — see the
                 constant — so the depth can be dialled down by eye without
                 ever reaching a map the detector let through.
    `flat_target`  how much of a CORRECTED field's surface the tone curve
                 aims to leave within +/-`FLAT_BAND` of its median; 0 disables
                 the curve.  This is the SHAPE correction, and it is the only

                 parked at the bottom of the channel and gets the re-centring
                 shift ALONE — no compression, no curve.  0 disables it.

    The tone curve runs first, then the compression around the field's own
    median so the relief keeps its shape, and the shift last — limited so
    nothing is pushed past 0 or 255, because clipping would flatten real

# GLOBAL is the whole point.  Normalising each map to its own target amplitude
