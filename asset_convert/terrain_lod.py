"""Terrain LOD generation for TES4→TES5 worldspaces.

Reads LAND records (VHGT heights, VCLR vertex colors, ATXT/VTXT texture layers)
from the converted ESM and produces:
  meshes/terrain/<WRLD>/<WRLD>.<level>.<tx>.<ty>.btr   — heightmap NIF per tile
  textures/terrain/<WRLD>/<WRLD>.<level>.<tx>.<ty>.dds  — per-tile diffuse (DXT1)
  textures/terrain/<WRLD>/<WRLD>.<level>.<tx>.<ty>_n.dds — per-tile normal (flat)

LOD levels generated: 4, 8, 16 (cells per tile side).
Each tile covers level×level cells.

Vertex layout per tile: (level*32+1) × (level*32+1) vertices.
Each cell contributes exactly 33 verts per side (32 intervals), sharing the
boundary vertex with its neighbor, so a level-N tile has N*32+1 verts per side.
Local step = CELL_SIZE / (level*32) so that level verts × step = CELL_SIZE.
Heights are in Skyrim units (1 unit ≈ 1.4 cm).  Cell size = 4096 units.

    A CELL record an override plugin ships carries only the fields its author
    changed, so its XCLC grid coords may be absent. Coordinates are therefore
    resolved against the coords already learned from earlier files in load
    order before falling back to this file's own.

    `known_wrld_fid` is the target worldspace's FormID as resolved from the file
    that DEFINES it. An override plugin edits a master's worldspace through the
    master's GRUPs — its records sit under a type-1 GRUP labelled with the
    master's WRLD FormID — while shipping no WRLD record of its own. Passing the
    master's FormID in is what lets those edits be scoped correctly instead of
    falling back to a wildcard.

    `allow_unscoped` decides what "this file has no such WRLD record, and no
    FormID was supplied" means.

    True (the default, and correct for the file the worldspace is sourced FROM)
    keeps the historical fallback: take every LAND record, because a file being
    scanned for its own worldspace may name it differently, and returning
    nothing would silently produce no terrain at all.

    False is mandatory for OVERLAYS, where the same fallback is a data-
    corruption bug: it imports the plugin's OTHER worldspaces as if they were
    this one. Morrowind_ob.esm ships no TES4Tamriel WRLD, so all 5,796 of its
    Vvardenfell cells were collected into Cyrodiil's heightmap, overwriting
    5,787 of Oblivion's own Tamriel cells and stamping Vvardenfell across
