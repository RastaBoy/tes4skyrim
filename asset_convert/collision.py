    components of 384-610, so the hull's correct faces outvote it ~1000:1 and
    the deck stays inverted (you fall through the front of the chargen ship).

    It is also blind for a different reason — the deck is a ZERO-THICKNESS
    double-sided sheet in the render mesh, so its up skin and down skin share
    a plane (measured mean z 3.6533 vs 3.6787).  Step 2 weights votes by
    1/distance, so the coincident down skin scores ~200000 against the real
    walkable skin's ~33 and "nearest face wins" picks the wrong one.

    So this step asks the question that actually matters for a floor, and asks
    it PER TRIANGLE: of the render faces COINCIDENT with this down-facing
    collision face, which way does the nearest one point?  Coincident, not
    merely nearby — the render face has to BE this surface for its normal to
    settle the question, which is what makes the double-sided sheet decidable
    (the true skin sits ~0.004 away, any other surface is 0.2+).  A face with
    no coincident render skin is a genuine underside/overhang and is left
    alone.  On exUdeUship this flips the 6 foredeck faces the player falls
    through and leaves the other 357 down-facing faces untouched.

    Measured on exUdeUship by downward raycast (the engine's own test):
    fall-through cells 10 -> 0, walkable 92 -> 102.  Vanilla control sweeps
    (400 architecture + 400 dungeon + 61 ship meshes) report 0 regressions.

        independently of the winding that produces that facing.  A flatten
        reverses the winding but carries the stored normal through unchanged,
        so a triangle whose winding contradicts its own normal is damaged BY
        ITS OWN RECORD -- read off the file, not inferred.  This needs no
        adjacency, no oracle mesh and no thresholds, it is inert wherever the
        two already agree, and it is therefore safe on every plugin.

        It is also the only step that repairs VANILLA Oblivion, which is not
        clean: seIsland.nif ships 1480 of 3590 collision triangles contradicting
        their own normals, and the rocks tree measures 14.5% of decidable floor
        faces inverted.  You fall through the Shivering Isles island in vanilla
        because of it.

        Its limit is corruption that is SELF-CONSISTENT: where an exporter
        rewrote the normals to match the winding it emitted, both sources agree
        while both are wrong and nothing is left to detect.  That is the
        Morroblivion case (inuhlaaluuroomuside's 10 triangles all score dot
        +1.0 over an inverted floor), and it is what the gated steps below are
        for.

    Measured against the Oblivion originals of the same meshes (Nehrim
    re-exports assets Oblivion also ships, so the vanilla file is exact ground
    truth for what the winding should be), the damage is not scattered noise:
    reversal strictly alternates along the packed triangle order, and 97% of
    reversed triangles are explained by position within a flattened strip.
    That makes the repair a structural problem, not a guessing problem.

    STEP 1 — relative orientation (exact, no thresholds).
        Triangles sharing an edge must traverse it in opposite directions.
        BFS the shared-edge graph and flip whatever disagrees.  This undoes
        the dropped parity exactly and is completely inert on correctly wound
        input, so vanilla strip meshes pass through untouched.

    STEP 2 — absolute sign (only where step 1 cannot help).
        Step 1 makes a component self-consistent but cannot tell an outward
        surface from an inside-out one, because flipping every triangle of a
        component is also self-consistent.  A uniformly reversed floor
        (Morrowind_ob's inuhlaaluuroomuside) needs an absolute reference:

          * a CLOSED component must enclose positive volume;
          * otherwise the render mesh decides — the artist's visual winding is
            correct by construction, so collision facing opposite a co-located
            visual face is reversed.

        The visual vote requires a quorum: at least half the component's
        triangles must have seen a qualifying visual face.  Every false
        positive measured on already-correct vanilla collision came from a
        single stray facet (typically the far skin of a thin slab — an altar
        top, a shelf, a step tread) condemning a whole component; the quorum
        removes those while still deciding genuinely reversed surfaces, whose
        own render skin covers every triangle they have.

        Where neither test is decisive the component is left alone.  A lone
        down-facing surface is a perfectly valid ceiling or overhang, and
        flipping it would punch a new hole.

    Measured against the Oblivion originals (dungeons + architecture, 265
    meshes / 64k matched triangles): 99.8% of reversed triangles repaired,
    0.08% of already-correct triangles disturbed.  The previous heuristic
    (near-horizontal + coplanar-conflict + nearest-visual-face arbitration)
    scored 35.8% recall on the same corpus and left priorychapelinterior,
    skbridgesmall and rockgreatforest645lichen unwalkable.

    STEPS 1-3 ARE GATED (see collision_options); STEP 0 IS NOT.  Step 0 reads
    a fact the file states about itself, so it is always correct to apply.
    Steps 1-3 INFER the answer from adjacency, enclosed volume and the render
    mesh, and inference costs false positives: step 1 seeds each welded
    component from an arbitrary triangle and propagates that choice, so a
    component whose seed happens to be inward inverts wholesale
    (leyawiincastle02: 274 of 284 triangles flipped, 806 walkable raycast
    cells lost on a vanilla mesh).  They are worth that risk only where the
    authored normals have been destroyed and nothing else can recover the
    orientation.

    #     object flips the engine into the baked/anim-static path and the
    #     whole compound acts welded solid.
    #  2. mass>0 AND owns a constraint (mace-trap chain links: Oblivion holds
    #     whole traps keyframed until the trap script enables havok) →
    #     DYNAMIC, like vanilla trapmace01's links (ms=3, quality 4).

    #     STATIC with mass 0.  Vanilla chain/noose/trap anchors are ALWAYS
    #     static mass-0 bodies (NooseRopePiece01 root, trapmace Base01),
    #     never keyframed.
    #  4. BREAKAWAY pieces (mwallplankbreakaway01's 8 planks, IDCrumbleWall01's
    #     bricks): ms=6 bodies with real mass whose clip only creaks them off
    #     their mounting -- 15.19 deg and ZERO translation keys for the planks
    #     -- because the visible break is HAVOK taking over and letting the
    #     pieces detach and FALL.  Forcing those onto the plain keyframed path
    #     (which also zeroes the mass) pinned them forever: the clip played, the
    #     planks tilted, and then hung in the half-broken pose as a solid wall.
    #     Gates/portcullises are also ms=6 with mass but sit on the anim-static
    #     layers, so the authored OL_PROPS layer separates the two.
    #
    #     A breakaway piece still ships KEYFRAMED, exactly like Oblivion's
    #     `Unyielding = 1` (all 8 planks; the root is Unyielding 0 / mass 0):
    #     the body is HELD, following the clip, and only becomes dynamic when
    #     the animation ends.  Shipping it dynamic instead made the planks drop
    #     the instant the cell loaded, before the clip ever played.  What the
    #     breakaway flag changes is that the piece KEEPS ITS MASS, so the
    #     script-side release (ObjectReference.SetMotionType(Motion_Dynamic))
    #     hands Havok a body that can actually fall -- a mass-0 body would just
    #     hang there.  See script_convert PlayGroup handling.
    #  5. HELD TRAP islands (ctrapswingmacelong01's chain + mace,
    #     ctraplogs01's logs, cprollingrock01): ms=6 bodies with real mass
    #     that belong to a CONSTRAINED island.  Case 2 shipped these DYNAMIC,
    #     which is what made every swinging trap swing freely the moment the
    #     cell loaded, before anything tripped it.  Oblivion's own trap script
    #     states the contract in its header comment -- "On activation havok
    #     will turn on and logs will roll" (CTrapLogs01SCRIPT) -- and authors
    #     the whole island `Unyielding = 1`: the trap is HELD rigid until the
    #     trap script fires, exactly like a breakaway piece.
    #
    #     So a constrained trap island is a breakaway: ship it KEYFRAMED (held,
    #     not simulating) but KEEP the authored mass, and let the script-side
    #     SetMotionType(Motion_Dynamic) release start the swing.  Skyrim's own
    #     trapmace01 ships its links dynamic because a Skyrim trap has no
    #     script-held phase; ours must reproduce Oblivion's held phase instead.

    creature skeleton.nifs ship exactly `bodies - 1` constraints — every body

    Oblivion leaves some bodies unconstrained (its animators only needed them
    as collision, not as joints).  `hkx_ragdoll` already synthesizes joints for
    these on the skeleton.**hkx** side — but the engine also reads the NIF, and
    nothing was closing the tree there.  Census of our output before this fix,

    If the source child NiNode has a non-zero translation, that offset is baked
    into the collision shape vertices so the collision stays in the correct world
    position after being moved to the root (which is at the world origin).

    Returns True if a collision was hoisted.
