"""Work out which output textures the shipped plugin can actually ask for.

Oblivion's BSAs carry textures for content the conversion never emits — the
character/face/body art whose meshes are skipped outright being the biggest
block — and copying the texture tree wholesale ships all of it.

This module only BUILDS the keep-set (`build_refs`); `bsa_pack` applies it
while staging the textures archive.  Nothing here deletes.  An earlier design
ran as its own phase and unlinked from `output/`, which was wrong twice over:
the mesh phase re-copies the whole texture tree on every run, so the deletions
were silently undone (and thus never noticed when the keep-set was wrong), and
the user tests with loose files, so deleting from `output/` removed the very
assets under test.  Packing is the only phase that decides what ships.

The reference set is assembled from every producer of a texture reference,
without re-reading the (multi-GB) output tree:

  * meshes  — nif_converter harvests each mesh's texture paths as it writes it
              (batch_convert's stats['textures_used']), so this costs nothing
  * records — the plugin's own texture fields (EYES/HAIR icons, BOOK, LTEX...),
              read from the export text
  * late assets — speedtree NIFs, LOD .bto/.btr and _far meshes are generated
              after mesh conversion, so they are scanned from disk; there are
              few of them and they are small

Anything under textures/ that no reference names is left out of the archive.

    engine loads `brumawoodpost_n.dds` from the same folder. Nothing writes that
    down — not the NIF, not the record — and `_companions` only derives from the
    FULL name, so it produces `brumawoodpost_grey_n.dds`, which does not exist,

    NOT covered here: a diffuse whose own name ends in a map suffix, e.g.

    rather than a map. It is classified as a map, so it never enters
    `kept_stems` and can never rescue its own `headhuman_m_n.dds`. That file is
    kept anyway — `_companions` uses `continue`, not `break`, so a stem ending
