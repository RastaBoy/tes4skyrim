"""Generate the emissive lava-surface meshes for Oblivion's realms.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Oblivion renders the Deadlands lava as engine WATER: a WATR record whose
`TNAM.Texture` is a bright, scrolling, self-illuminated lava image, tinted by
the record's shallow/deep colors.  14 worldspaces and 46 cells in Oblivion.esm
point at one of those records.

Skyrim's water shader cannot do that.  Its complete pixel-constant set
(`BSWaterShaderPixelConstants`, read out of SkyrimSE.exe at 0x1455789) is

    ShallowColor DeepColor ReflectionColor FresnelRI CameraData ProjData
    VarAmounts SunDir SunColor NumLights LightPos LightColor WaterParams
    DepthControl SSRParams

- no diffuse texture slot and no emissive term.  The three colors only tint a
reflection/refraction result.  All 93 NNAM entries across vanilla Skyrim's 34
WATR records name the same DefaultWater.dds, which is the normal/noise map,
not a color map.  So a WATR alone can never look like lava, however its colors
are set: Oblivion's authored values are DARK (79,12,2) precisely because they
were tinting a bright emissive texture that Skyrim has no way to sample.

Bethesda hit the same wall and solved it with geometry.  Dawnguard's Aetherium
Forge (cell DLC1Bthalft01) layers two things:

  * `LavaSettings` (WATR) reached through the cell's XCWT — the PHYSICS and
    the underwater tint, plus an INAM image space for being submerged.
  * `DweSpecialForgeLava01/02/03.nif` — the LOOK.  Each is an ordinary mesh
    carrying a BSEffectShaderProperty:
        source_texture     textures\\dlc01\\clutter\\WavyTurbulence01.dds
        greyscale_texture  textures\\effects\\gradients\\GradHotCoals.dds
        emissive_color     1,1,1   emissive_multiple 2.0
        controller         BSEffectShaderPropertyFloatController -> U Offset

That is the mechanism this module reproduces.  Bethesda needs the greyscale +
gradient pair because WavyTurbulence01.dds is a colorless turbulence pattern;
Oblivion's own lava texture is ALREADY full color (decoding oblivionlava06.dds
gives (230,97,49), (222,64,32), (205,52,24) — mean channel spread 151 of 255),
so it goes straight into source_texture and no gradient is needed.

The WATR conversion is left alone and still does its job — swim behaviour,
damage, fog and the underwater tint.  This module only adds the visible
surface on top of it.
